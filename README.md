Course Enrollment System 
We are trying to create a collection of RESTful web services to automate the process of enrollment for Compro students. Each Compro student should be able to create up to 4 enrollments for the future 4 blocks during the enrollment period. Faculty should be able to “view” the enrollment for any student. Admins should be able to add new courses and offerings and edit any enrollment record.
